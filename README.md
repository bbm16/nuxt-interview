# CommonShare Car Project

Hello! I'm Borja B, and that's the project for the Common Share technical task.

## Linter & Prettier

For a better readability and understanding of the project I added _Linter & Prettier_ into the project.

Command: `yarn lint`

## Routing

The Router is dynamically generated by Nuxt, I decided to keep it like this as it's a very simple project. In case this project scales and have more complexity on routing, I would move it statically to a `router.ts`

## Styling

Decided to go for a straight-forward **tailwind approach.** However, I keep open the posibility to use some custom **Sass** if needed. In this case I just use it for importing Figma's font: _Plus Jakarta Sans_.

## Store

Created a Pinia store for managing the cars. Also, I decided to move the fetch's in the actions of that store. It's **unit tested with Pinia testing tools.**

## Search Box

Implemented a re-usable search box with a **custom composable** which **queries the API through the cars store.** To avoid performance issues, it's doing **debounce** over the keyup's. I'm using two utilities from `vueuse` for showing - hidding. It's fully tested through Vitest.

## Pagination

Implemented pagination to load more results and **hide the button if reached the limit.**

## Testing

For me testing in crucial in a project, so I decided to develop it through _TDD:_

- Unit Tests: provided by **Vitest.**

- Integration Tests: **Vitest + Vue Testing Library** I can add **Ax** if needed.

- E2E: Not provided yet. But I can do it if needed: **Nightwatch** or **Cypress**

Tests run over this command `yarn test`

## Web Vitals

Website is optimized for SEO and current Google standards through web vitals - lighthouse.

- The decrease of accessability on the home screen, it's related with the contrast of blues provided on the figma.

## Deployment

I added some minor **Github CI actions** for ensure code passes the correct standards (Build and Tests).

# Comments / Suggestions about the project:

- **Typescript.** Implemented the maximum possible for the time I have. Created a `@/models` with all the project types.

- I had **issues with CORS** when doing the pagination & search from the client, but I made It work by moving the requests always on the server side of Nuxt âœ…

- If we want to avoid this, we would need to whitelist my domain and get rid of the Cors issue. Anyway it's a good approach if for example we never want to expose an API KEY from the service.

- I didn't do it, but this is a very nice part to implement a caching system through Nitro, for example Redis. That way, our requests for cars (popular, etc), would be much quicker.

- I implemented **cache for the car likes.**

- I would suggest adding **i18n** translations and have a folder with the JSON's files. Sync with some external service like **Lokalise or Phraseapp.**

- I enterily recommend adding some bug-reporting tool like **Sentry.**

- In this App, ideally there should be a swiper. I didn't do it for the moment (just used some scrollers), just ping me if it's needed and I can create one from scratch.

- There's an improvement for the API. When the car doesn't exist, it should return a 404 error, not a 200 error with a 404 status code on the body - I did a workaround for this.

- A good improvement would be to implement **Nuxt/Image**. A very great tool for optimizing the performance through the images. Suggest to add new image formats like `.webp`
